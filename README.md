# regalter-utility

Regalter: A simple utility for changing the registered owner and registered organization names without messing with Windows registry. This source code available here is for the 
64-bit version of Regalter, created exclusively for running on 64-bit Windows. I will be uploading the code for the 32-bit version very soon, with some minor changes to the 64-bit
source file (regalter.py). This code has only been tested on Windows 7 and Windows 10, but it should work on the previous versions of Windows too (although I'm not sure about the
previous ones), just informing this in the highly unlikely event someone might be interested in rigorously test out my code's compatibility.
